# About Lucy M.G. Watcher:
  **I want a job doing something meaningful, where I have to solve problems, and coding seems like a path for that**. Over the past few months, I have been learning Django, NGINX, Linux, JS/ECMAScript, GitHub, and AWS deployment. My goal is to host a Portfolio site with a few demo apps entirely on my own. I want the site to demonstrate my new skills, as well as my ability to learn and/or understand documentation quickly. 
  
  When I work on my portfolio, I usually do so for 10+ hours, reading documentation, taking notes, or writing code all day. Since I started my portfolio, most of my weekends have been spent coding. I hope my aggressive efforts and a decent portfolio might be enough to let me begin an entry-level coding job despite the fact that I have not gone to college. 
  
  I am very new to GitHub, but I am learning it now, as part of my journey!
  
# Otherwise!;
  I'm 19. My favorite color is lavender.
  
  I started out coding, many years ago, by writing batch-file games or messing with [scratch.mit.edu](https://scratch.mit.edu/). Eventually, I started learning python and web development.

  I'm a musician, and I aspire to make my own music tool one day. I started my journey making music with an online tool, [beepbox.co](https://github.com/johnnesky/beepbox). I started making music in 6th grade using this tool. It changed my life in so many ways, so I aspire to make something like that.

  I very badly want to know how everything works! I hope that one day, I will understand everything from machine code to 3D rendering... I'd love to learn how to make devices from soldered components, or how to host a streaming site. It seems to me like there are resources to create anything I can imagine if I have the dedication to learn.
  
  I've always made tiny little games in various engines and languages.  When I started making music in 6th grade alongside my friends, we were trying to make themes for characters we would draw together. Our characters were inspired by our favorite games. I think those games, and their stories, had a big impact on me. One day, I'd like to release a game with intricate visuals and a story that is emotionally impactful. I think it would be a meaningful tribute to my old friends, and a tribute to the games/stories that influenced my life. To me, it would be very meaningful.
