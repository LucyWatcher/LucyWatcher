# About

  I'm 19. My favorite color is lavender.
  
  I started my journey making music with an online tool, [beepbox.co](https://github.com/johnnesky/beepbox). I started making music in 6th grade using this tool. It changed my life in so many ways, so I aspire to make something like that. When I started making music with my friends in 6th grade, we were trying to make themes for characters we would create together. Our characters were inspired by our favorite games. One day, I'd like to release a game. I think it would be a meaningful tribute to my old friends, and a tribute to the games/stories that influenced my life.
